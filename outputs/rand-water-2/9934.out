     estimated scf accuracy    <          9.2E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -74.38544209 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      39.61778028 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -14.09237891 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -14.18282917 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.04265994 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  56 iterations
