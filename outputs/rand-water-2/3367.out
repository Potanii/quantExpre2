     the Fermi energy is    -6.6852 ev

!    total energy              =     -63.10238414 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -63.10238418 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.7E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -77.35607371 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      41.21588483 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -14.10040848 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -12.82566699 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03611979 Ry
