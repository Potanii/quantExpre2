     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -63.03884303 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          4.2E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -86.47941182 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      45.76132231 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -14.07019212 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -8.20878554 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.04177585 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  56 iterations
