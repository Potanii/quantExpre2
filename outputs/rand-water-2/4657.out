!    total energy              =     -63.19494723 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -63.19494724 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          2.6E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -83.03114608 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      44.03777612 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -14.11377851 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -10.05530048 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03249828 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  56 iterations
