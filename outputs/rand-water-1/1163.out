     one-electron contribution =     -46.40550897 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      24.36457341 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.21567328 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -2.56293614 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.01536989 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
