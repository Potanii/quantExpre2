     the Fermi energy is    -6.8838 ev

!    total energy              =     -31.50547245 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -31.50547249 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.7E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -40.92098417 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.70805653 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.04578955 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.22514478 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.02161048 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  50 iterations
