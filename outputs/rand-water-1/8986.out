     one-electron contribution =     -39.61677200 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      20.85733099 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.06480494 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.80846876 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.01520048 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
