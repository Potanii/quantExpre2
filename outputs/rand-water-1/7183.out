     the Fermi energy is    -6.8613 ev

!    total energy              =     -31.49108023 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -31.49108022 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          8.4E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.61976173 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.08699368 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.06108478 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.86382445 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03340294 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  23 iterations
