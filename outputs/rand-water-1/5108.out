     one-electron contribution =     -38.98973601 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      20.74913769 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.05771184 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -6.15885581 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03316643 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  55 iterations
