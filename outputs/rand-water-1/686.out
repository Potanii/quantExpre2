     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -41.05212860 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.74989130 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.03954501 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.15570290 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.01663018 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
