     estimated scf accuracy    <          2.5E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -40.26122894 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.36698990 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.04829236 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.52591531 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.02769039 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  56 iterations
