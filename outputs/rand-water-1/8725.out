     the Fermi energy is    -7.7534 ev

!    total energy              =     -31.69924273 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -31.69924272 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          9.5E-11 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.73463231 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      20.88297891 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.09136759 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.74124922 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.01497253 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
