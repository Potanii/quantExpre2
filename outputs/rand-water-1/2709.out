     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.89425342 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.21268397 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.05887034 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.71880721 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03253732 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
