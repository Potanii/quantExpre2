     the Fermi energy is    -6.9652 ev

!    total energy              =     -31.49549499 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -31.49549499 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.2E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.91211608 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.18968121 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.04851867 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.69642223 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.02811922 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  57 iterations
