     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -31.73608204 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.6E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -40.64900717 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.31211496 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.11400430 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.27046940 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.01471615 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
