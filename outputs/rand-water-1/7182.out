     the Fermi energy is    -6.8617 ev

!    total energy              =     -31.49094569 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -31.49094571 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          9.2E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.56192035 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.05806674 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.06141125 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.89210102 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03357981 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
