     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.82580313 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.18648989 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.06136584 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.75662753 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03356156 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
