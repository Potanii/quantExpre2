     estimated scf accuracy    <          7.7E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.14719758 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      20.82223442 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.05547294 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -6.07867690 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03212158 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
