     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.5E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -41.33249123 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.89466504 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.03958507 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.00694809 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.02082336 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
