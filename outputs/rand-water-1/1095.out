     estimated scf accuracy    <          7.7E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -40.19660771 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.34688994 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.05369419 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.55993863 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03033891 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
