     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.4E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -41.60163781 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      22.02150095 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.04850952 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -4.91905540 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.01743315 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  57 iterations
