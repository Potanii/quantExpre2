     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.5E-11 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.47013395 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.00796665 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.06130692 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.93346995 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03370836 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  56 iterations
