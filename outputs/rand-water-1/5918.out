!    total energy              =     -31.49068165 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -31.49068165 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          2.5E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -39.50431200 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      21.02791735 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -7.06139959 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -5.91922342 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.03366399 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  23 iterations
