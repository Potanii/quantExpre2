     one-electron contribution =    -609.73919187 Ry
     hartree contribution      =     326.29839354 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -51.40288504 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       5.35639299 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00405563 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   9 iterations
